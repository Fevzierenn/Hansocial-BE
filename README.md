## Project Introduction
This project is a user-friendly social media platform created by effectively integrating modern software development technologies. Designed as an application where users can interact with each other, share posts, and manage content, it combines robust backend and frontend technologies. The project is optimized using Docker virtualization tools and deployed to the cloud environment on Google Cloud, providing wide accessibility.

## Features of the Project
One of the most remarkable features of the platform is the ease with which users can register and log in to the system. After registration, users can create profiles, share posts, like and comment on other users' posts. Additionally, on the My Profile page, users can view, edit, or delete their own posts and comments. They can also personalize their accounts by changing their profile avatars, making the application more interactive and user-centered.

## Technological Infrastructure
Backend:
The backend of the application is developed using Java Spring to provide a robust and reliable infrastructure. Spring is chosen for its high performance and scalability. The main dependencies added to the project via start.spring.io include:

Spring Web
Spring Boot DevTools
MySQL Connector
Spring Data
Frontend:
React is used to create a user-friendly interface. React's component-based architecture ensures a fast and seamless user experience.

##  Virtualization and Cloud Integration
The application is virtualized using Docker Compose, enabling it to run independently, be easily portable, and quickly deployed across different environments. In the final stage of the project, the application was deployed to the cloud environment using Google Cloud, making it accessible worldwide. Cloud technology provides scalability and uninterrupted access, enhancing the platform's efficiency and reliability.
